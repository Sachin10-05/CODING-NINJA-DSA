1) Circular doubly LL:
   Given an unsorted circular doubly linked list, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, 
   which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?
   i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
  ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
 iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
  iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list
  
  a) I and II
  b) I,II and III
  c) I,II,III and IV ✔
  d) None
